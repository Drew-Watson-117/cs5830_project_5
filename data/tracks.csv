But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers
I recall

And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night
And I think I might have it all

And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me
He can take away

And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified
As the man who stands to lose you

Why the hell can't I just be American without getting political?
The system gon' suppress us all, they don't care about the cost
How's this a democracy when we got communists in charge?
Cancel culture, Nazis, all they're missing is the swastikas
Honestly, this is a psychological holocaust
Pumpin' propaganda through the screen and straight into your brain
You ain't on a plantation, but you definitely still a slave

Race theory is indoctrinating children
Tell blacks they're disadvantaged, tell whites they got white privilege
What a brilliant way to reinforce division
If whites believe they have it easy they will never help you fight the system
And now they burnin' books in untraditional ways
They just traded newspapers for the digital age
Now the facts can be deleted with no physical flames
They just change the information and the truth gets erased

They keep screamin' to wake up, but they're all woke, not awake
We know the system has failed us, and all the media's fake
I swear the government hates us, having opinions is dangerous
The system built to enslave us only works if we're afraid

And how that's gonna be
When my skin and bones give up the ghost
And I finally feel my fragile soul
And all I am falls into mystery

Most of the time I'm somewhere in between

Don't the question beg an answer?

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crises
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time

It's me
Hi!
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go""

""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (high, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said, ""Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy""
Manifest destiny back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, ""Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams""
Museum victories everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said, ""Don't give up, it's a little complicated

I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-ah-ah
And they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Overtime hours for bullshit pay
So I can sit out here and waste my life away
Drag back home and drown my troubles away

It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me, people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is oh, it is

Livin' in the new world with an old soul
These rich men north of Richmond
Lord, knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do

282,33999328,"25 years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

And I say, hey yeah yeah-eh-eh, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?
And I say, hey yeah yeah-eh-eh, hey yeah yeah

As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave (wave) is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons, they fill you with fear
The trouble, it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were goin'

Now, Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I buried my faith with you
I'm screamin' at a God I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

I'm still holdin' on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye, 'cause this one means forever
And now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
