This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
Then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to

He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

When I was doing bad, and I had to do it by myself

A headlights turned off (now that it's bad news dog)

I keep on telling Jelly, he caught in a murderous game
But if you know Jelly, you know that there's no telling him anything

But God never called the equipped, he equipped the call
My homie said rains, the only thang in this forecast
He solved his problems out of a bottle of Loretta's

Mixed it with the liquor in attempts to get rid of
All of his life problems and say good riddance
And then he took a Xanax bar to balance the other
And when that didn't work, he would mix it with an upper
Now he's losing his mind because he speed ballin'
His heart rates climbing but feels like he's fallin'
His heart stopped, ain't know what to do
And the sad part is that was a good dude

We can do what you want, girl, whatever you feel
We can take it from Tennessee back to Beverly Hills, yeah

Make a livin', came from the bottom. baby

You know I'm wit it, now you see it in my eyes how the fat man feel it
Ridin' round lit with a bad bitch with me and struggle got next
Ask Catfish Billy, we goin' stand for the city like the Batman building
Me and Alexander King had a conversation
'Bout how these bitches need a confrontation
Better not try us, not for playing
Right there in the cut, got the monsters waiting
Ha!
Until then

Roll up that smoke and pour yourself a drink
'Cause around here, ya can do anything
What's mine is yours, man, it's our family
That's just my Southern hospitality
Came from the bottom, seen alot of things
So being cool sometimes is challenging
You disrespect me bitch, I guarantee
That I will lose my Southern hospitality

Alright

I've had my cape on lately, I've been tryna save the past
I've been talking to the soil and a million blades of grass
I've been feeling good, but I know feelings fade fast
Some days I really feel as if I'm 'bouta crash
But I can't slow down now, no time for a breather
I gotta get this money, Lord knows, my family needs it
We were just a kid, smoking weed under the bleachers
Came from the bottom, baby, we were the breachers

Sunday for the preachers, save it for the sinners
Y'all know me something like greens and chicken fried dinners
""This gon' be okay,"" that's what the man from church said
I've seen a diction fuck up a family firsthand
Anytime I'm stressed out, I can hear my homies voice
In my head telling me, ""To stay calm pon' it, boy""

See, my childhood was kinda split
It was cool
Because it was just constant chaos

In the spare room or on the couch
My mother was real musically driven
She was a woman that
When you woke up in the mornin'
Was in the kitchen singing fuckin'
'Bout dealing emotions

It's easy for me
To go and tell a story on a beat
But sometimes I cannot see
The forest for the trees
And when I was young and dumb
They said here the trouble comes
And the way I dealt with that
Was to roll up another one

Tennessee born
Tennessee raised
Man I'm so stuck in my Tennessee ways
Ten drinks ain't enough we should double it
Up and get so fucked up I can't remember my name
I love tequila
I love the women
I love smokin' on killer shit
And I love them loud guitars with those 808s, I swear I be feelin' it

If I could fit my sorrows in a glass

If life was that easy then I'd never have to worry for the rest of my days
But life just ain't that easy, oh no, no-no
It's taken its toll on me deep down, in my soul

Cheers, bottoms up
I wish that I could roll my problems up
Wish I could put 'em in a pill and just swallow 'em
Wish I could swallow 'em every time I pick the bottle up
Then I would chug, chug
You know that I would kill it, get fucked up
I wish that that would end it
Driving and my liquor meant the drummer would be finished
But in reality that would just be the beginning

I really got a feeling that it's not for me to change
Instead of really dealing with it, I just keep running away
I gotta start dealing with the shit that's on my plate
But it's hard when I'm sick from the shit that I done ate

Saw yourself sitting pretty in the big city
And now you're big-time digging on some little bitty
Back roads, real slow
Got your hand out the window

Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about

Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, ""It's gonna be awhile,"" ha
Didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?

Getting Tennessee tipsy in the neon light

Pissed off enough to pick herself up a pack of smokes
Even though she don't
Flip a quarter, roll the dice
It's a left or it's a right
One's goin' my way
And one's hell on a highway

Heads its headlights, headed home
Tread left on forgiveness
Tails, it's taillights tailin' off
Floor that Ford, forget this
Is that half ton kickin' up
That last goodbye cloud of dust it's gonna give me
Or does she miss me?

With you and God, who's my sunlight I'll bloom and grow so beautifly
Baby I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go on away from this cold and mixed-up world

(I'm) I'm in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way you love, you lovin' me

'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin' me

You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why

Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home

Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare

Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu

'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you

Like a perm that's been left too long
It's starts to burn, the result is it just won't take
Now it's all coming so clear to me now (I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness (I can see)
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can't do

So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light

Talking to the girl
She said, ""Know what, grow up, you nasty,""
""I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me,""
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
That's good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe

And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can't barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I try to be patient but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe

And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart

I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strain
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable

And it's a heartbreaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do, it's a catch with it to
Cause the cure is found in you, I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addiction, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right, take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?

What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

Siempre van acompañarme hasta el fin

Cada noche a mentir

Comprender mucho mejor

De perder a quién se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me how is that

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna to take breath without you babe
I don't wanna to play that part

I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart

More brain than an IQ
More head than a drug, buy yours

I like to joke around a little bit but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world
Of gold-plated Earl, cause
Everything I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl
She said, ""Know what, grow up, you nasty,""
""I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me,""
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
That's good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe

You can see that I got it goin' on

I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strain
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable

And it's a heartbreaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do, it's a catch with it to
Cause the cure is found in you, I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addiction, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right, take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?

What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

Do you really hate me?

Still love and it's still love, and it's still love

And you're thinking, that maybe you made a mistake

One is a giver, and one's always trying to take
All they can take

So, I'm saying goodbye
To the people that I feel are real good at wasting my time
No regrets, baby
I just think that maybe
You go your way and I'll go mine
It's been a real good time

내 이름을 한 번만 더 불러주세요
얼어버린 노을 아래 멈춰 서 있지만
그대 향해 한 걸음씩 걸어갈래요, still with you

어두운 방, 조명 하나 없이
익숙해지면 안 되는데 그게 또 익숙해
나지막이 들리는 이 에어컨 소리
이거라도 없으면 나 정말 무너질 것 같아

함께 웃고, 함께 울고
이 단순한 감정들이 내겐 전부였나 봐
언제쯤일까 다시? 그댈 마주한다면
눈을 보고 말할래요 ""보고 싶었어요""

In the blink of an eye, the dark faded out
Blooming under the sunlight

I'll love you when you're barely holdin' on
Lighting up the darkness
I can be a shoulder when you're not strong

Closer

It said, ""Go home, ain't nobody love you no more""
I can't disagree
So last night, I went to the club
Had a couple too many, threw up
Now, everybody's laughing at me

'Cause I'm way too sad, way too sad to dance
I'm way too sad to dance

'Cause I got too caught up, my friends agree
A broken heart and nobody
And that's why I'm too sad to dance
And now I just wait by the telephone
You ain't coming back and I should've known
And that's why I'm too sad to dance

She said, ""Boy I'm down, if you wanna come find me""
I said, ""Watchu wearing girl? There's something I'm tryna see""
Told me, ""Come and get it"", said she wanna surprise me
Bet, give me like an hour and a half
With the homies right now and we bout to get a snack
In the mean time, you can take a shower or a bath

Like a sneaky pedophile that steady lurking with his pants down
They been fucking with the kid, yeah the youngin is legit
Ace Pro up on production he be coming with the hits
Now she come in to the crib
Got your boyfriend sensing danger
Know my pull-out game is strong
Just tell him we were playing Jenga

Working on escaping my destiny in the cubicle
Recipe for success is just blessing, beats, and a studio
People are fucking twisted, can't never seem to get through to them
Tell me you want me dead but say Rest in Peace at my funeral
Damn, I wish I could call you
These are days I'm gon be looking back on with some nostalgia
But now it seems like you want someone different to call up
And kiss and just ball up and cuddle with
I miss you it's awful

Well I'm good, yeah I'm good

My dad built houses, my mom painted pictures
They both gave it up once I came into the picture
Me, I'm like them, just a fifty-fifty mixture
My mom rode horses, she wish I had a sister
I prefer the pen to a hammer or a brush
But I build things up and my imagery is lush
I used to play soccer but I never had the touch
Basketball, too, but I ain't love it that much

Much of my time's spent lookin' for a rush
Tryna find something to afford me that feeling
I fall in love with girls 'cause they physically appealing
A couple weeks pass and the convos hit a ceiling
I've smoked a fеw blunts, cookies, and runtz
Gotten high enough to know it isn't what I want
Mеt the celebrities, seen through the fronts
Dated one girl and I've seen two at once

I ain't upset to be inside for some months
And get back in touch with the person that I was
Know I've given too much of my time to the chase

It can't be the way that I've stuck with the same friends
It can't be the swag I got when I walk in

It can't be the way that I treat people
Or how I make time to see people
And make sure that they feel like we equals

We grew up in the same household
For years, we were close
Throwing football in the yard 'til the lights turned on inside the lampposts
Years go by
Something changed when you got to junior high
And started hanging with them guys

Suddenly I meant nothing to you
You wanted nothing to do with me
You run with a crew that doesn't include any room for your little brother
I was destroyed but I still loved ya

I still wanted your approval, if I could get it, I'd cherish it
Embarrassing me any chance you got but I didn't care
Because maybe if I was tough enough to take it you would love me
Instead of looking at me like I'm disgusting

Like I'm nothing
Like I'm not the person that you grew up with

Why I gotta get so intimate with all my lovers?
Why I gotta cheat and make her question if I love her?
Why am I so flawed?
Why am I so skeptical of God?
Why do I pretend like I didn't see it when I saw it?

Why am I so bold to double back when I've been caught?
Why am I not the superhero I thought?

When did the texts you send me stopped getting replies?

We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start sayin' things

Yeah, I hurt you and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more, and so I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

For tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight, pretend that it's all alright (all alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes

Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper, but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Like poison coursing through me

He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him
You ain't gettin' over him

I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in

I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity

He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I can feel it inside

Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red

I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going

It's like I buried my faith with you

'Cause I don't know what else I can do

To everything that's dead and gone

The future will take us places that we can't imagine yet

Yours is the face I could never forget

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared

It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

""You'll never reach it""
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shaking

But I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be a uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there

At your place, or up in space
You can, you can meet me out, as long as I see your face
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, letting go of my heart

You take me higher, than I've been before
Don't laugh when I say that, 'cause we just smoked a bowl
And I, I have a hard time, anyway, saying how I feel
But I'm a little buzzed, so I'm keeping it real

I'm tryna', take it slow, but
When you're around me, my pot's about to blow, and
Everything you do just turns me on
So let's go to my room and, na, na

Shit's about to get real freaky, I can feel it
I hope you're ready, I'm into whatever
Shit's about to get real freaky, I can feel it

Stay a while, stay a while with me (mm, no, oh)
Stay a while, put your arms around me
Put them around me

When the floor is wet
And the lights come on, but you don't wanna leave
Can I bum a cigarette? (bum a cigarette)

And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave
And your phone is lost
But the car's outside waitin out on the street

Tonight we'll just be wrong
Ain't done this in so long
We ain't gotta talk baby
We'll keep the stereo on
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave

Stay awhile, stay awhile with me
Stay awhile, don't deny the violet chemistry
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me
Stay awhile, put your arms around me
Put them around me

And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave

Who the hell you think you're messing with
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit
And I don't know

Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit

And you smell like perfume that I didn't purchase
Now I know why you've been closing the curtains (uh-uh)
Get the fuck out of my house

You're coming 'round with your muddy feet

Go and meet your mom in a dress too tight
Maybe I could stay and not break your heart

And don't wait for me

So close to heaven, but so far from everyone
Yeah, I've got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I'm still wishin' for the love that I don't have

Mama told me, ""Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em""
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sittin' here wonderin' all day long

Am I stranded (am I stranded) on an island? (On an island)
Or have I landed (have I landed) in paradise?
Am I stranded (am I stranded) on an island? (On an island)
Or have I landed in paradise?

I can paint my toenails while I'm soakin' up the sea
The only thing that's missin' here is you and our TV
And I won't lie, it sure gets lonely here at night
But no one here needs nothin' from me, and it's kind of nice

Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

I didn't wanna leave you
I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can

Paint my nails, cherry red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways

Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far

I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young

You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'cause I used to be young

Take one, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
