This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
Then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to

He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

When I was doing bad, and I had to do it by myself

A headlights turned off (now that it's bad news dog)

I keep on telling Jelly, he caught in a murderous game
But if you know Jelly, you know that there's no telling him anything

But God never called the equipped, he equipped the call
My homie said rains, the only thang in this forecast
He solved his problems out of a bottle of Loretta's

Mixed it with the liquor in attempts to get rid of
All of his life problems and say good riddance
And then he took a Xanax bar to balance the other
And when that didn't work, he would mix it with an upper
Now he's losing his mind because he speed ballin'
His heart rates climbing but feels like he's fallin'
His heart stopped, ain't know what to do
And the sad part is that was a good dude

We can do what you want, girl, whatever you feel
We can take it from Tennessee back to Beverly Hills, yeah

Make a livin', came from the bottom. baby

You know I'm wit it, now you see it in my eyes how the fat man feel it
Ridin' round lit with a bad bitch with me and struggle got next
Ask Catfish Billy, we goin' stand for the city like the Batman building
Me and Alexander King had a conversation
'Bout how these bitches need a confrontation
Better not try us, not for playing
Right there in the cut, got the monsters waiting
Ha!
Until then

Roll up that smoke and pour yourself a drink
'Cause around here, ya can do anything
What's mine is yours, man, it's our family
That's just my Southern hospitality
Came from the bottom, seen alot of things
So being cool sometimes is challenging
You disrespect me bitch, I guarantee
That I will lose my Southern hospitality

Alright

I've had my cape on lately, I've been tryna save the past
I've been talking to the soil and a million blades of grass
I've been feeling good, but I know feelings fade fast
Some days I really feel as if I'm 'bouta crash
But I can't slow down now, no time for a breather
I gotta get this money, Lord knows, my family needs it
We were just a kid, smoking weed under the bleachers
Came from the bottom, baby, we were the breachers

Sunday for the preachers, save it for the sinners
Y'all know me something like greens and chicken fried dinners
""This gon' be okay,"" that's what the man from church said
I've seen a diction fuck up a family firsthand
Anytime I'm stressed out, I can hear my homies voice
In my head telling me, ""To stay calm pon' it, boy""

It was cool
Because it was just constant chaos

In the spare room or on the couch
My mother was real musically driven
She was a woman that
When you woke up in the mornin'
Was in the kitchen singing fuckin'
'Bout dealing emotions

It's easy for me
To go and tell a story on a beat
But sometimes I cannot see
The forest for the trees
And when I was young and dumb
They said here the trouble comes
And the way I dealt with that
Was to roll up another one

Tennessee born
Tennessee raised
Man I'm so stuck in my Tennessee ways
Ten drinks ain't enough we should double it
Up and get so fucked up I can't remember my name
I love tequila
I love the women
I love smokin' on killer shit
And I love them loud guitars with those 808s, I swear I be feelin' it

If I could fit my sorrows in a glass

If life was that easy then I'd never have to worry for the rest of my days
But life just ain't that easy, oh no, no-no
It's taken its toll on me deep down, in my soul

Cheers, bottoms up
I wish that I could roll my problems up
Wish I could put 'em in a pill and just swallow 'em
Wish I could swallow 'em every time I pick the bottle up
Then I would chug, chug
You know that I would kill it, get fucked up
I wish that that would end it
Driving and my liquor meant the drummer would be finished
But in reality that would just be the beginning

I really got a feeling that it's not for me to change
Instead of really dealing with it, I just keep running away
I gotta start dealing with the shit that's on my plate
But it's hard when I'm sick from the shit that I done ate

Saw yourself sitting pretty in the big city
And now you're big-time digging on some little bitty
Back roads, real slow
Got your hand out the window

Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about

Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, ""It's gonna be awhile,"" ha
Didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?

Getting Tennessee tipsy in the neon light

Pissed off enough to pick herself up a pack of smokes
Even though she don't
Flip a quarter, roll the dice
It's a left or it's a right
One's goin' my way
And one's hell on a highway

Heads its headlights, headed home
Tread left on forgiveness
Tails, it's taillights tailin' off
Floor that Ford, forget this
Is that half ton kickin' up
That last goodbye cloud of dust it's gonna give me
Or does she miss me?

You are my raindrops, I am the seed

With you and God, who's my sunlight I'll bloom and grow so beautifly
Baby I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go on away from this cold and mixed-up world

(I'm) I'm in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way you love, you lovin' me

'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin' me

You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me

We in trouble but you won't meet me at the bridge

You gon' make me call somebody

You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago

It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me

Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
Could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag'
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home

So go ahead and get gone

Rolling her around in the car that I bought you

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)

My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strain
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable

And it's a heartbreaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses but time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do, it's a catch with it to
Cause the cure is found in you, I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addiction, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right, take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?

What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I've got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted

Now put your hands up

Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me

I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
You can't be mad at me
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
That's good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league

But I know (it's gonna take the real work), whoa-woah
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally, you put me first

Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

Ooh, come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh-ooh, come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
Put my love on top, my love on top

Traded that county maintain for a four lane city street

But sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be
What you want ain't always what you need

Don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find

Boys chase girls goin' thirty miles an hour
Circle up at the Dairy Queen
Later on, the wild gets louder
Like a rural route movie scene
In the nowhere dust, fallin' in love underneath an endless sky
Pick a map dot town
That's how it goes down

And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him

Been so lost without you all around me
Get anxious
Lead me, don't look back, it's all about you

In the dark right now
Feeling lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins, and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about

Blood stain on my shirt, new bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved, going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth, still stressing perfection
Let you all in my mental, got me looking too desperate
Damn, you ain't deserve

I wrote this song with Shane McAnally and Brandy Clark
And it's gotta be, I don't know if I can pick a favorite on the record

Um, sonically I love Red sets
It kinda reminds me of Glen Kimble a little bit, or Marty Robins
Um, a little bit of Loretta in there somewhere maybe
It's uh, it's real country, it's real simple but the lyrics
Are not your typical country song

And um, just I'm just all about people just doing what they want to do
Um, and you know the song deals with homosexuality
And uh, some other subjects you know, people may not be comfortable with
But um, growing up in a conservative environment and then getting out
And having a best friend come out to me, you know right after high school
And just seeing the struggle that he went through

It may not completely benefit both parties anymore

Ain't all that it's made out to be
You get your fill and leave empty
More lonely than before
And you lay beside
Somebody you know isn't right
I make believe it's love, then I

If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight
Despite, the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad

Blooming under the sunlight

All these times are precious due to you
Four seasons have passed with you
Four scents were left 'cause of you

It's my way of putting feelers out
All the traffic in my head's going crazy
I'm gonna trust my heart right now

And if it's better to bet on us, then I'll double down
And if we end up in bed and I put the covers out
And if I'm wrong, I'll just bury my head deep underground
I gotta know

Are you feeling the rush?
If so, then I think I know what's going on
And are we falling in love? Say yes or no
Yes or no, yes or no

Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us)

'Cause I got too caught up, my friends agree

I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin' but most of y'all can't help me (Nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it, like ""What's up?"" (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up

Have you ever heard of personal space?
I walk around town in a hoodie and some shades
But now they starting to recognize the shades
Even if you hate me, you would trade
You would live this life too 'cause I got it made
I like my bed made, soon enough, I'll have a maid
When I buy a house, every surface gon' be suede

But for now, I got a concierge downstairs
All my neighbors are gray-haired
They don't recognize me and I don't think they care
But my Postmates can't believe that I stay here (fuck)
I wanna go back to Kentucky and shut down the state fair
Visit my old teachers and tell 'em to take care
I might take a whip instead of paying the plane fare
I still remember the way there (way there)

Ain't a girl in my hometown I can't have now
Buy a building in cash, ain't putting half down

Frat boys saying ""no cap, put racks on it""

As my kiss goes down
You like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
Is that darker side of me
That makes you feel so numb?

'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you burn yourself
Many answer to your prayers
I'll give you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell (hot, hell)
Hotter than hell (hot, hell)

Tell me, is there light on the outside?

So, are we leavin' this garden of Eden?
Are we leavin' this garden of Eden?

Used to walk around your apartment
With nothing but a smile on me
But tonight, I'm so self-conscious
Isn't it so clear to see? (Oh)

Feel your eyes, they're all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight

Hypnotized, pull another one

I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol

He doesn't love me so I tell myself, I tell myself
Let me hear you

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion

There's a fire rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song

They whisper to me
They know a secret
I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long for the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us

Must have been something sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence, 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

It's hard now to let you be

Stomach's so full that I wish I could choke
Seven a.m., my head's already in a spin

As soon as I'm out that door
Bam, it hits me like a ton of those red bricks
Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch
This madness

I swear sometimes I can't tell
Which way's up, which way's down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away
Somebody push it away, so all that I can hear
Is a simple song, sing along now

La, la, la, la, la

You've been on my mind
Since I woke up today, up today
I look at your photograph all the time

These memories come back to life
And I don't mind

I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
'Cause I remember the simple things
I remember 'til I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget is goodbye

You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
So shine your light as I reach for you

It runs through my blood

I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

I used to believe love conquers all
Cause that's what's seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see, real life's much different

I don't want to see you go
I only want to see you smile

Felt like this for awhile

When you know I'm not one to keep dealing with the shit

I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

If I spend a week without you

You can be whoever you wanna be here

And oh, I've been living at the ChÃ¢teau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here

Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close

I've been California dreaming
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (keep me up)
Keep me up all night (all night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (keep me up)

Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I've had time to think it over
We're much older and the bone's too big to bury

Oh, isn't it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to hell, but we never came back

I'm sorry that you're jaded
I could've taken you places
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded

So we put on our shade
Somehow the bedsheets are dirty
Like sticky sweet lemonade

Never wanna leave this room
Daydream, dÃ©jÃ  vu
If I had control over you

We could stay like this forever, lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds, fallin' stupid like we're kids
Wearin' rose colored lenses, let's just play pretend
Wearin' rose colored lenses, pretend we'll never end

Naked in conversation
Drown me in your delight

I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways

Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far

I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young

You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'cause I used to be young

Take one, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout

I'm driving around town in a beat up old Mercedes
You think I'm crazy
You might be right
But when he smiles, I don't care about the past
Just like that

I told myself I closed that door, but I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense,
So don't ask me where I been

I'm not always right
But still I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind
But still I'm holding on like a rolling stone

Smoke Cuban cigars and get kicked out of bars before two
But only if it's with you
I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kinda reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it's with you

I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage, but you're lookin' past it
I want that late night sweet magic, that forever-lasting love

Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beam down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
In the sky, we can see the riders on horseback
On comets
Coming toward us, kicking up with laughter
My friend Big Twitchy rode the boat into the light
Surfed the north break
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy
'Cause that's all we knew

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Will you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop

Heart beats so loud that it's drowning me out
Living in an April shower
You're pouring down, baby, drown me out (ooh, ooh, ooh)
